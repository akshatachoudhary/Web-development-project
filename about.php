        <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <img src="new_img/mm.jpg" alt="">
        <p align="justify">Historically, professional interior design was an expensive luxury. Luckily for consumers, though, hiring a designer just became affordable with new online business models, standardization and price transparency. 

A new bespoke decor service that claims to be "changing the design industry one interior at a time," Homepolish matches clients with local interior designer talent (based on zip code), available for hire by the hour, at a reasonable price. A one-hour consult in the customer’s home is available at a cost as low as $50.

Founded in New York City in 2012, the online company standardizes the process of working with interior designers, wholly disrupting a traditionally word-of-mouth industry. The business-savvy leadership team claims to have a hefty roster of celebrity clients to kick its visibility into high gear from the start.</p>
